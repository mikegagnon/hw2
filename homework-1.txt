Section 1
=========
Create a new directory somewhere on your system, called "workspace"

Inside "workspace" create a dir called "homework-1"

Inside "homework-1" create three files (all empty files at first):
- a file called index.html
- a file called style.css
- a file called homework-1.js

Fill in index.html so it contains:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Page Title</title>
<body>
   <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

This html file came from https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_html.asp

Open the index.html file in your browser, and observe what it looks like.

Section 2
=========
Now, edit style.css so it contains:
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}

This css file came from https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

Now, we need to edit index.html so that it loads the css file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

Notice, I have added a "head" elemt, which wraps around the "meta" element, the "link" element, and the "title" element.

The "link" element is used to import the style.css file.

Now, reload the index.html page in your browser.

The page should look different.

Section 3
=========
Now, edit homework-1.js so it contains:
function handleClick() {
	alert("Hi there!");
}

Now, we need to edit index.html so that it loads the .js file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1 onclick="handleClick()">This is a Heading</h1>
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
<script src="homework-1.js"></script>
</html>

Notice two changes:
  1. the h1 element now has an "onclick" attribute
  2. a "script" element has been added, to import the .js file

Reload the .html file in your browswer, then click on the heading that says "This is a Heading." A little popup should pop up that says "Hi there!"

The End.

Section 4
=========
Now, let's add some interactivity to our page using JavaScript. We'll create a button that changes the color of the heading when clicked.

First, add a button to your HTML file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1 id="mainHeading" onclick="handleClick()">This is a Heading</h1>
   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
   <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
   <button id="colorButton">Change Heading Color</button>
</body>
<script src="homework-1.js"></script>
</html>

Now, update your homework-1.js file to include the following code:

function handleClick() {
	alert("Hi there!");
}

function changeColor() {
    const heading = document.getElementById('mainHeading');
    const randomColor = Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16);
    heading.style.color = "#" + randomColor;
}

document.getElementById('colorButton').addEventListener('click', changeColor);

This JavaScript code does the following:
1. We keep the original handleClick() function.
2. We add a new changeColor() function that generates a random color and applies it to the heading.
3. We add an event listener to the button that calls the changeColor() function when clicked.

Reload your HTML file in the browser. Now you should see a button below the paragraphs. When you click this button, it should change the color of the heading to a random color.

This demonstrates how we can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) and respond to user interactions.
